### Connection Issue: Black Screen

It seems that your player's save is corrupted (see "Wipe of my character").

To resolve this, you need to delete the save of your character located in `/Pal/Saved/SaveGames/0/4BD87C2145BCD3916C05D8B0498854D8/Players/`.

>[!TIP]
> Instead of risking deleting the wrong save file, you can rename it so that the server can't find it anymore. For example, you can prefix the file name with an underscore (`_`).
